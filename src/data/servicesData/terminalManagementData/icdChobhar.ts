    description: `Chobhar ICD is located in the southwestern corner of Kathmandu Valley in Kirtipur district and spreads over 11.77 hectares. It is divided into two sections: EXIM and DOMESTIC. Inland Clearance Depot will allow importers to make customs clearance of their goods in Kathmandu itself, saving them trips to various border checkpoints from where shipments enter Nepal and will help facilitate trade and transit. Operationalization of this ICD would minimize the cost of logistics, time and problems related to the import and export of goods.

Chobhar ICDâ€™s relevance will increase further once the Kathmandu-Terai expressway project comes into implementation or a railroad arrives to Kathmandu.

Some of the key facilities within the ICD complex include:`
