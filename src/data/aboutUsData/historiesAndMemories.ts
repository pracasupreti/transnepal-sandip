        'INAUGURATION CEREMONY HELD ON 17TH APRIL 2002 AT INLAND CLEARANCE DEPOT BIRATNAGAR',
    description:
        'Nepal is a land linked country having China on the northern side and India on the southern side. Hence establishment of dry ports were of utmost importance to boost trade and transit because port is the gateway to trade growth and it further facilitates transit. By the year 2002, three ICDs viz Biratnagar, Bhairahawa (both road-based), and Birganj (rail-based) were ready to be operationalised under the PPP model. NITDB, a regulatory body under the MoICS, invited a global tender where TransNepal, after being technically qualified and tendering the highest bid, was awarded the operation and management of ICDs Biratnagar and Bhairahawa. The company took charge and started operation of both ICDs on 17th April, 2002 from NITDB. A ceremony was held on the opening day itself at the Biratnagar ICD premises where Honorable Minister Mr. Purna Bahadur Khadaka, MoICS was the chief guest and inaugurated the event. The program was very upbeat and attended by people from across the board like bureaucrats, customs officials, business fraternity, and others.'
